    <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b> Fermentation</b>, chemical process by which molecules such as glucose are broken down anaerobically. More broadly, fermentation is the foaming that occurs during the manufacture of wine and beer, a process at least 10,000 years old. The frothing results from the evolution of carbon dioxide gas, though this was not recognized until the 17th century. French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur in the 19th century used the term fermentation in a narrow sense to describe the changes brought about by yeasts and other microorganisms growing in the absence of air (anaerobically); he also recognized that ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide are not the only products of fermentation. 

<b></b></p><center><p><b>Anaerobic breakdown of molecules</b></p></center>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the 1920s it was discovered that, in the absence of air, extracts of muscle catalyze the formation of lactate from glucose and that the same intermediate compounds formed in the fermentation of grain are produced by muscle. An important generalization thus emerged: that fermentation reactions are not peculiar to the action of yeast but also occur in many other instances of glucose utilization. The term fermentation now denotes the enzyme-catalyzed, energy-yielding pathway in cells involving the anaerobic breakdown of molecules such as glucose. In most cells the enzymes occur in the soluble portion of the cytoplasm. The reactions leading to the formation of ATP and pyruvate thus are common to sugar transformation in muscle, yeasts, some bacteria, and plants. The main purpose of fermentation is to regenerate the electron carriers used in glycolysis and produce a small amount of ATP. Preservation of foods by fermentation is a widely practiced and ancient technology. Fermentation ensures not only increased shelf life and microbiological safety of a food but also may also make some foods more digestible and in the case of cassava fermentation reduces toxicity of the substrate.</p>

    <p><b>Who Discovered the Fermentation Process?</b></p>
    
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Louis Pasteur</b>, a scientist, was the first to discover the fermentation process in 1857. 

	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Pasteur proved in 1857 that living beings produce lactic corrosive ageing. In 1860, he demonstrated that tiny organisms generate sourness in water, a process previously thought to be merely a chemical alteration, and his work in discovering the role of microbes in food degradation prompted the pasteurisation procedure.

	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Pasteur demonstrated lactic acid fermentation in live organisms, specifically yeast, in 1857. He demonstrated that yeast, living cells, were responsible for the formation of alcohol from sugar. In 1860, he established that bacteria create sour milk, which led to the development of the pasteurisation procedure.</p>
    
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Louis_Pasteur%2C_foto_av_Paul_Nadar%2C_Crisco_edit.jpg" style="width=700" height="400">
  
  <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The practice of fermentation has existed in ancient history. People have been applying the basic steps of fermentation in their food and beverages. They were making beer from malted barley, wine from grapes, chicha from maize, and octli (now known as “pulque“) from agave, a type of cactus.</p>
  
  <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;People were able to produce these beverages by placing them inside the tightly covered containers and then leaving them for over a certain period of time but no one knew how this practice worked. It was only in the 17th century that people began to understand the biology of it when microscopes and lenses were invented. Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, for instance, was able to see for the first time various microorganisms, including yeasts. As more powerful microscopes were contrived, scientists were able to learn more about multifarious microorganisms. Charles Cagniard de la Tour found out that yeasts are microorganisms and might have been associated with the fermentation process. He observed them multiplying by budding during alcoholic fermentation. However, our modern understanding of the biology and chemistry of fermentation comes from the work of Louis Pasteur, a French chemist and microbiologist. In the 1850s and 1860s, he was the first to demonstrate through experiments that living yeasts were the ones responsible for transforming glucose into ethanol in fermented beverages. And these yeasts were able to do so in the absence of oxygen. He described the process as “respiration without air”. </p>
  
  <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Pasteur also identified two types of fermentation: alcoholic fermentation which he attributed to the multiplying yeasts and lactic acid fermentation by the growing bacteria. (Ref. 8) This was based on his observations where he found out that sugars were converted into alcohol in the presence of live yeast and that the “souring” of the beet juice was due to the presence of live bacterial species, which led to the conversion of ethanol into acetic acid. Pasteur, however, did not know exactly how these organisms caused fermentation.</p>
  
   <img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7239/26868595020_224a35be75_o.jpg">
  
  <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;By the end of the 19th century,<b>Eduard Buchner</b> (German chemist) found that by pulverizing the yeasts cells and extracting “press juice” from the yeasts he was able to incite the conversion of sucrose to alcohol and carbon dioxide. He coined the term “zymase” to refer to the compound extracted from yeast that catalyzed the conversion in alcoholic fermentation.</p>
  
  <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since then, more organisms have been identified to carry out fermentation, including the cells of human muscles. .</p>

    <img src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aerobic-and-anaerobic-respiration.png" class="w3-image" style="width:100%">
    
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What is the process of fermentation? Does fermentation require oxygen? Fermentation is an anaerobic process. It does not use oxygen. The fermentation reaction entails two major steps: (1) glycolysis and (2) electron transfer from NADH to pyruvate or its derivatives. The first step — glycolysis — is similarly the first step in cellular respiration. Glycolysis means “splitting of sugar“. That’s because, glucose, a 6-carbon sugar molecule is split into two pyruvates (a 3-carbon compound) after glycolysis. </p>
  
  <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In glycolysis, glucose is oxidized to pyruvate to harvest chemical energy. The first phase is called an energy-investment phase because the process uses ATP molecules. The next phase is an energy-payoff phase. That’s because ATP is now produced via substrate-level phosphorylation. </p>
  
  <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Aside from ATP, NADH, another high-energy molecule, is produced. NADH is produced when glyceraldehyde phosphate (product of the energy-investment phase) is oxidized and then the H+ and the electrons are transferred to NAD+. </p>
  
  <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The end product of the energy-payoff phase is pyruvate. Pyruvate is, then, used in the next step of fermentation, which is the electron transfer from NADH to pyruvate or its derivatives. This step regenerates NAD+, which is important because it is used in glycolysis during the energy-payoff phase, as mentioned above. </p>
  
  <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;How much ATP does fermentation produce? Because fermentation skips the citric acid cycle after glycolysis, the energy gain is two ATP molecules per glucose molecule. But what about the NADH produced in glycolysis? As described above, NADH is consumed in the second step when the electron from NADH is transferred to pyruvate or its derivatives, e.g. acetaldehyde. Thus, there is no net NADH production during fermentation. This is also why there is no ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation but only substrate-level. In cellular respiration, NADH enters the electron transport chain to transfer the electron along the chain and produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. </p>
  
  <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Where does fermentation occur? Glycolysis and the electron transfer from NADH to pyruvate or its derivatives occur in the cytoplasm (particularly, the cytosol). </p>
  
  <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What causes fermentation? The presence of pyruvate coming from glycolysis incites fermentation. Some cells that respire aerobically (e.g. muscle cells) may resort to fermentation when oxygen is scarce and yet there is high energy demand. The muscle cells seem to “buy time” by using fermentation to generate energy quickly until such time that the muscle cell can respire again when the oxygen supply is no longer limited. </p>
    
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fermentation happens in anaerobic conditions (i.e.,without oxygen). Fermentation begins with glycolysis which breaks down glucose into two pyruvate molecules and produces two ATP (net) and two NADH. Fermentation allows glucose to be continuously broken down to make ATP due to the recycling of NADH to NAD+. </p>

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-48"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">TYPES OF FERMENTATION</span></h5>
    
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There are many types of fermentation. But the three types of fermentation that are commonly used in the industry are lactate fermentation, ethanol fermentation, and acetic acid fermentation. In brief, lactate fermentation produces lactate, ethanol fermentation produces ethanol, and acetic acid fermentation produces acetic acid. The first two types of fermentation are further described in the preceding sections. </p>
    
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fermentation activity occurs in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Nevertheless, bacterial fermentation and yeast fermentation are the most commercially valuable. They are used in the food industry. </p>
    
    <b><p>Alcoholic fermentation</p></b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; a type of fermentation wherein the end product is alcohol, e.g. ethanol. The yeasts, for instance, are used to ferment sugars in fruit juice (e.g. grapes) to produce alcohol. </p>
    
	<b><p>Lactate fermentation</p></b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a type of fermentation wherein the end product is lactate. This is used to produce cheese. Certain bacteria, e.g. Lactococcus or Lactobacillus spp. are used to convert lactose in milk to lactic acid. </p>
    
	<b><p>Acetic acid fermentation</p></b>
    <p>a type of fermentation wherein the end product is acetic acid. </p>
    
    <b><p>Ethanol Fermentation</p></b>
    <img src="https://biologydictionary.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Ethanol-fermentation.jpg" class="w3-image" style="width:100%">
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In ethanol fermentation, the pyruvate produced through glycolysis is converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide in two steps. First, the pyruvate releases carbon dioxide to form a two-carbon compound called acetaldehyde. Next, acetaldehyde is reduced by NADH to ethanol, thereby regenerating the NAD+ for use in glycolysis. Overall, one molecule of glucose is converted into two molecules of carbon dioxide and two molecules of ethanol. </p>
    <p>Ethanol fermentation is typically performed by yeast, which is a unicellular fungus. </p>
    
    <b><p>Lactic Acid Fermentation</p></b>
    <img src="https://biologydictionary.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Lactic-acid-fermentation.jpg" width="700" height="400">
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There are two main types of lactic acid fermentation: homolactic and heterolactic. In homolactic acid fermentation, NADH reduces pyruvate directly to form lactate. This process does not release gas. Overall, one molecule of glucose is converted into two molecules of lactate. In heterolactic fermentation, some lactate is further metabolized, resulting in ethanol and carbon dioxide via the phosphoketolase pathway. </p>
    
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Lactic acid fermentation is primarily performed by certain types of bacteria and fungi. However, this type of fermentation also occurs in muscle cells to produce ATP when the oxygen supply has been depleted during strenuous exercise and aerobic respiration is not possible. </p>

   <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Philippine archipelagois home to a diverse array of ecosystems, organisms, peoples, and cultures. Filipino cuisine is no exception as distinct regional flavors stem from the unique food preparation techniques and culinary traditions of each region. Although Philippine indigenous foods are reminiscent  of various foreign influences, local processes are adapted to indigenous ingredients and in accordance with local tastes. Traditional fermented foods are part and parcel of Filipino culture since these are intimately entwined with the life of local people.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There are many variables involved in the fermentation process. These include the micro-organisms at work, the nutritional contribution of the ingredients used and the environmental conditions to which the food is exposed. Consequently, these factors give rise to thousands of different variations of fermented food, with associated differences in their nutritional contribution and microbial diversity.</p>
    
     <h3><b><p>Health Benefits of Fermented Foods:</p></b></h3>
     
  <ul>
<li>Improves Digestive Health</li> 
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The probiotics produced during fermentation can help restore the balance of friendly bacteria in your gut and may alleviate some digestive problems. Evidence suggests that probiotics can reduce uncomfortable symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common digestive disorder. One 6-week study in 274 adults with IBS found that consuming 4.4 ounces (125 grams) of yogurt-like fermented milk daily improved IBS symptoms, including bloating and stool frequency. What’s more, fermented foods may also lessen the severity of diarrhea, bloating, gas, and constipation. For these reasons, adding fermented foods to your diet may be useful if you regularly experience gut issues.</p>

	<li>Boosts Your Immune System</li>

	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The bacteria that live in your gut have a significant impact on your immune system. Due to their high probiotic content, fermented foods can give your immune system a boost and reduce your risk of infections like the common cold. Consuming probiotic-rich foods may also help you recover faster when you’re sick. Additionally, many fermented foods are rich in vitamin C, iron, and zinc — all of which are proven to contribute to a stronger immune system.</p>

<li>Makes Food Easier to Digest</li> 
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fermentation helps break down nutrients in food, making them easier to digest than their unfermented counterparts. For example, lactose — the natural sugar in milk — is broken down during fermentation into simpler sugars — glucose and galactose. As a result, those with lactose intolerance are generally fine eating fermented dairy like kefir and yogurt. Plus, fermentation helps break down and destroy antinutrients — such as phytates and lectins — which are compounds found in seeds, nuts, grains, and legumes that interfere with the nutrient absorption. Therefore, consuming fermented beans or legumes like tempeh increases the absorption of beneficial nutrients, making them more nutritious than unfermented alternatives.</p>
</ul>     

	<h4><b><p>Other Potential Benefits:</p></b></h4>
    
<li>Mental health</li> 
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A few studies have linked the probiotic strains Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum to a reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression. Both probiotics are found in fermented foods.</p>

<li>Weight loss</li>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While more research is needed, some studies have found links between certain probiotic strains — including Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus gasseri — and weight loss and decreased belly fat.</p>

<li>Heart health</li> 
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fermented foods have been associated with a lower risk of heart disease. Probiotics may also modestly reduce blood pressure and help lower total and “bad” LDL cholesterol .</p>

	<h5><b><p>Safety and Side Effects:</p></b></h5>
  <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fermented foods are considered safe for most people. However, some individuals may experience side effects. Due to the high probiotic content of fermented foods, the most common side effect is an initial and temporary increase in gas and bloating. These symptoms may be worse after consuming fiber-rich fermented foods, such as kimchi and sauerkraut. It’s also important to note that not all fermented foods are created equal. Some products may contain high levels of added sugar, salt, and fat — so it’s important to read nutrition labels to make sure you’re making a healthy choice. If fermenting at home, make sure you follow recipes closely for safety purposes. Incorrect temperatures, fermentation times, or unsterile equipment can cause the food to spoil, making it unsafe to eat..</p>
